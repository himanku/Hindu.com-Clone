        title2: "The announcement was made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of RBI",
        content: "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on September 30, 2022 increased policy repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 5.9% making loans expensive. The MPC also lowered the growth projection of FY23 from 7.2% to 7%. Growth for the second quarter has been projected at 6.3%, for third quarter 4.6%, for the fourth quarter 4.6% and 7.2% for the first quarter of the next financial year. Inflation projection for FY has been retained at 6.7%. While the projection for second quarter is 7.1%, the projection for third quarter and fourth quarter is 6.5% and 5.8% respectively. For the first quarter of the next financial year, inflation has been projected at 5%. Announcing the monetary policy RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while explaining the rationale behind the rate hike said the MPC was of the view that persistence of high inflation necessitates further calibrated withdrawal of monetary accommodation to restrain broadening of price pressures, anchor inflation expectations and contain the second- round effects. Despite this unsettling global environment, Mr Das said the Indian economy continues to be resilient. “There is macroeconomic stability. The financial system remains intact, with improved performance parameters,” he said. “The country has withstood the shocks from COVID-19 and the conflict in Ukraine. Our journey over the last two and half years, our steely resolve in dealing with the various challenges gives us the confidence to deal with the new storm that we are confronted with,” he added. ",
